%% For example, suppose Problem 2 is

%% \begin{solution}{2}

%% sides of the equation to get $x=5-3=2$, so the 
%% solution is $x=2$.

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}{2}
We have our six numbers, $x, y, z, x-y, y-z, x-z$, all of which are prime.
Firstly, $x, y$, and $z$ must be distinct. If they are not distinct, then one of $x-y, y-z,$ or $x-z$ must not be zero, which is not a postive integer.
Let us then split this problem into two cases:

\textbf{1. None of $x, y, z$ are $2$}

If this is true, then $x, y$ and $z$ must be odd, as there are no even primes other than $2$.
However, this means that $x-y, y-z, x-z$ must be even, as they are the result of subtracting two odd numbers.
Therefore, $x-y$ and $y-z$ must both be $2$, since it is the only even prime.
However, if

\begin{center}
\begin{cases} x-y = 2 \\ y - z = 2 \end{cases}
\end{center}


Then

\begin{align*}
x - z &= (x - y) + (y - z)\\
&= 2 + 2\\
&= 4
\end{align*}

Therefore, $x-z$ is not prime, and therefore, if $x, y$ and $z$ are not $2$, then at least one of $x-y, y-z$ or $x-z$ is not prime.

\textbf{2. one of $x, y, z$ is $2$}


We know that $z$ must be $2$, as $x-z > 0$ and $y-z > 0$, $x > z$ and $y > z$, and $2$ is the smallest prime.
Because we know $z = 2$, $x-2$ and $y-2$ must be prime. Additionally, $x$ and $y$ are odd, as they are distinct from $z$ and $2$ is the only even prime. 
Therefore, $x-y$ is even, as it is the result of subtracting two odd numbers. The only solution for $x-y$ is therefore, $2$, and therefore, $x = y + 2$

Since $x = y + 2$ and $y-2$ must be prime, $x-4$ must be prime. 

$x, x-2$ and $x-4$ must all be prime. But this is impossible, as $x, x-2$ and $x-4$ are all distinct $\bmod{3}$, and therefore by pidgeonhole principle, one of them is divisible by $3$

Therefore, there are no triplets $(x, y, z)$ such that $x, y, z, x-y, y-z, x-z$ are all prime.
